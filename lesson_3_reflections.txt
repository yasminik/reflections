When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
  when I work for another person's project or when I work on a huge project
  
Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
  Because GitHub cannot know when the document ready for pull. It it is automatic files can be pulled in the middle of the changes which creates confusion / broken code etc.
